roshanjson: Write content for the README.md file

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create a comprehensive README.md file for your school equipment lending portal project. I'll analyze the project structure first and then create appropriate documentation. 

Created [](file:///e%3A/BITS%20MTech/Semester_2/FullStackApplicationDevelopment/Assignment1/school-equipment-lending-portal/README.md)

I apologize for the error. Let me read the existing README.md first and then make appropriate updates. 

Read [](file:///e%3A/BITS%20MTech/Semester_2/FullStackApplicationDevelopment/Assignment1/school-equipment-lending-portal/README.md)

Now I'll update the README.md file with comprehensive documentation. 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I've updated the README.md file with comprehensive documentation that includes:

1. Project overview and features
2. Complete tech stack details
3. Project structure explanation
4. Installation and setup instructions
5. Running instructions for both frontend and backend
6. Testing information
7. API documentation location
8. Contributing guidelines
9. License information

The documentation is now much more detailed and helpful for anyone who wants to understand or contribute to the project. Let me know if you'd like any sections to be modified or expanded further!

Made changes.
